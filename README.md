# Disk_Mounter
 Easy Disk mounter for windows 10
This script is written in Python to mount disks read-only or read-write on windows helping the user mounting disks if you disable the automount.
Be also careful using this around disks that are encrypted with softwares like bitlocker,... You can have problems with them.
This program was firstly created to help on windows forensics, but I guess it can help with other things.
Last but not least, the software is free to use as you want but be very careful about the things you do with it, if you use it, will be on your responsibility.
